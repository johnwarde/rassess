# TODO: 

# Notes from PDF:
# * Your solution should contain a textual description (ca. 1 page pdf) of your 
#   approach to the problem, including any assumptions you make.
# * Your code must be runnable, in other words it should be possible to source your
#   script in a brand new R session with the data set in the working directory. If you
#   use any R libraries (you may or may not), add a comment stating which functions
#   you are using from that library.
# * You will get more marks if your code is readable, well-indented, and above all
#   well-commented.
# * You will get more marks for appropriate use of the built-in functions of R and its
#   libraries.
# Marks
# * Correctly solve the problem for the 90 day data: up to 20 points
# * Be able to limit the analysis to a certain number of days: 5 points
# * If your solution is parallelised: extra 20 points
# * If your solution uses out-of-memory data: extra 20 points
